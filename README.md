A Flutter plugin for [Plaid Link](https://plaid.com/docs/link).

This plugin integrates the native SDKs:

- [Plaid Link iOS SDK 5.x.x](https://plaid.com/docs/link/ios)
- [Plaid Link Android SDK 4.x.x](https://plaid.com/docs/link/android)
- [Plaid Link JavaScript SDK](https://plaid.com/docs/link/web)

Feel free to leave any feedback [here](https://github.com/jorgefspereira/plaid_flutter/issues).

## Requirements

In order to initialize Plaid Link, you will need to create a link_token at [/link/token/create](https://plaid.com/docs/#create-link-token). After generating a link_token, you'll need to pass it into your app and use it to open Link:

``` dart
...

LinkTokenConfiguration _configuration = LinkTokenConfiguration(
    token: "<GENERATED_LINK_TOKEN>",
);

/// Creates a internal handler for Plaid Link. A one-time use object used to open a Link session. Should always be called before open.
PlaidLink.create(configuration: _configuration);

/// Open Plaid Link by calling open on the handler.
PlaidLink.open();

...

```

Note that each time you open Link, you will need to get a new link_token from your server and create a new LinkTokenConfiguration with it.

A link_token can be configured for different Link flows depending on the fields provided during token creation. It is the preferred way of initializing Link going forward. You will need to pass in most of your Link configurations server-side in the [/link/token/create](https://plaid.com/docs/#create-link-token) endpoint rather than client-side where they previously existed.

If your integration is still using a public_key to initialize Plaid Link, the LinkConfiguration class has support for it. Check the [migration guide](https://plaid.com/docs/upgrade-to-link-tokens/) to upgrade your app to the link_token flow.

## Installation

Add `plaid_flutter` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/).

## iOS

### Requirements

- iOS version >= 14.0
- Xcode 14 or greater

### (Identity Verification only) - Enable camera support 

When using the Identity Verification product, the Link SDK may use the camera if a user needs to take a picture of identity documentation. To support this workflow, add a `NSCameraUsageDescription` entry to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` with an informative string. 

### OAuth configuration

If your integration uses only Identity Verification or Monitor, this steps can be skipped; they are mandatory otherwise.

Registering your redirect URI:

- Sign in to the Plaid Dashboard and go to the Team Settings -> API page.
- Next to Allowed redirect URIs click Configure then Add New URI.
- Enter your redirect URI, which you must also set up as a Universal Link for your application, for example: https://app.example.com/plaid/.
- Click Save Changes

These redirect URIs must be set up as [Universal Links](https://developer.apple.com/ios/universal-links/) in your application.

## Android

### Requirements
#### Gradle Configuration

Go to the project level `android/app/build.gradle` and make sure you are using a minSdk >= 21

### (Identity Verification only) - Enable camera support

If your app uses Identity Verification, a user may need to take a picture of identity documentation or a selfie during the Link flow. To support this workflow, the CAMERA, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, RECORD_AUDIO, and MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS permissions need to be added to your application's `AndroidManifest.xml`.

#### Register your App ID

- Sign in to the Plaid Dashboard and go to the Team Settings -> API page.
- Next to Allowed Android Package Names click Configure then Add New Android Package Name.
- Enter your package name, for example com.plaid.example.
- Click Save Changes.
